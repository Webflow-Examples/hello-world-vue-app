## Branch naming convention

This repo is the canonical `hello-world-<framework>-app` example. Every framework
version and variant lives on a branch here, not in a separate repo:

| Branch | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Current default example. Advances to the latest framework version once dependent pipelines are updated. |
| `vN` | Framework major version N, no storage bindings (for example `v6`). |
| `vN-with-bindings` | Version N plus D1, R2, and KV bindings and a `/api/binding-status` health check. |
| `sentry` | Latest version with bindings, plus a working Sentry setup. |

### Adding a new framework version

When a new major version M ships:

1. Create `vM` from the new plain app and `vM-with-bindings` from its bindings variant.
2. Point `sentry` at the latest version with bindings.
3. Leave `main` until the pipelines that consume this repo (webflow-cli,
   infrastructure/cosmic-builder, cosmic-test) are updated, then advance `main` to `vM`.
4. Keep older `vN` / `vN-with-bindings` branches so pinned references keep working.

Version branches (`vN`, `vN-with-bindings`, `sentry`) are protected: they can't be
deleted or force-pushed.
