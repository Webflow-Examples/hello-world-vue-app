# hello-world-vue-app-bindings

A **Vue 3 + Vite** starter for [**Webflow Cloud**](https://webflow.com/cloud) with Cloudflare bindings (D1, R2, KV) wired in.

At deploy time, Webflow Cloud provisions the configured services and injects them into your app as typed bindings — no API keys, no connection strings.

> Looking for the plain vanilla variant (no bindings)?
> See [`hello-world-vue-app`](https://github.com/Webflow-Examples/hello-world-vue-app).

> **Sentry / observability example:** the
> [`feat/sentry-integration-example`](https://github.com/Webflow-Examples/hello-world-vue-app-bindings/tree/feat/sentry-integration-example)
> branch adds a working Sentry setup — browser + server logs on every request,
> error capture, and a recurring ping endpoint — validated on the Cloudflare
> Workers runtime Webflow Cloud uses. See its README for setup.

## Requirements

- Node **20+**

## What's included

- Vue 3 + Vite 6
- Tailwind CSS v3
- `worker/index.ts` — Cloudflare Worker serving the SPA and a `/api/binding-status` endpoint
- `wrangler.json` with **D1**, **R2**, **KV · Sessions**, **KV · Flags**
- Branded landing page that renders real-time binding status

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install

# Run locally (Vite only, no bindings)
npm run dev

# Build + preview against real bindings (wrangler)
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to Webflow Cloud

1. Fork this repo.
2. In your Webflow site, open **Apps → Webflow Cloud → Create new app** and select this repo.
3. Webflow Cloud reads `wrangler.json` and provisions D1, R2, and KV automatically.

## Bindings map

| Binding    | Type | Declared in     |

## Branch naming convention

This repo is the canonical `hello-world-<framework>-app` example. Every framework
version and variant lives on a branch here, not in a separate repo:

| Branch | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Current default example. Advances to the latest framework version once dependent pipelines are updated. |
| `vN` | Framework major version N, no storage bindings (for example `v6`). |
| `vN-with-bindings` | Version N plus D1, R2, and KV bindings and a `/api/binding-status` health check. |
| `sentry` | Latest version with bindings, plus a working Sentry setup. |

### Adding a new framework version

When a new major version M ships:

1. Create `vM` from the new plain app and `vM-with-bindings` from its bindings variant.
2. Point `sentry` at the latest version with bindings.
3. Leave `main` until the pipelines that consume this repo (webflow-cli,
   infrastructure/cosmic-builder, cosmic-test) are updated, then advance `main` to `vM`.
4. Keep older `vN` / `vN-with-bindings` branches so pinned references keep working.

Version branches (`vN`, `vN-with-bindings`, `sentry`) are protected: they can't be
deleted or force-pushed.
